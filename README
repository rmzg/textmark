Textmark version 0.01
=====================

Textmark is a Lightweight Markup Language designed for plain text document composition. That is, creating documents using an editor that supports no internal markup such as a browser's textfield or notepad.

Syntax definitions are as follows:

= H1 Header =
== H2 Header ==
=== H3 Header ===
==== H4 Header ====
(Larger numbers means smaller headers)

* Unordered bullet points
* With multiple items
* * And nested
* * Lists

# Ordered lists
# With multiple items
# # and nested
# # Lists


	This code is indented by one tab
	And represents a codeblock

You can also indent with 3 or more spaces or use:

``````````````````
This is also a codeblock
Delimited by backticks
The number of backticks is optional as
long as they're the only thing on the line
and the number is greater than 3.
``````````````````

Block quotes:

> quote test
> from other sources
> by prefixing each
> line like so

Paragraphs are any remaining chunks of text separated by an empty line.
Note that paragraphs will continue on to the next line so when you want
to break the paragraph, insert an empty line!

A number of formatting options are supported:

*bold* text
/italic/ text
_underlined_ text
`inline code`

You can produce hyperlinks by using the following syntax:
[link title](http://hyperlink.destination.com/)

Or insert images using:
[Image alt text](http://example.com/example.png)
